# Installation
From the Julia REPL enter package mode using `]` and then type:

```julia-repl
pkg> add https://github.com/ArturoAmaya/CurricularAnalyticsDiff.jl
```

This is because this package hasn't been published publicly yet. Hopefully, it will be soon.

In order to use the package, type:
```julia-repl
using CurricularAnalyticsDiff
```

Please remember that every time you restart the Julia REPL you must re-run the `using` command
