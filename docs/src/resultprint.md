# Result Print
This is a group of functions that print the results of a curricular diff operation in a human-legible way.
There are two flavors: executive summary and pretty print.

Executive summary is a simplified version with little explanation of why the changes have occurred.

Pretty print is a more detailed version that attempts to explain why changes have occurred.
