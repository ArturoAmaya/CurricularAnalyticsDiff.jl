# Diff
This is the original functionality of the package. It lets a user see the differences in the important metrics of a curriculum - blocking factor, delay factor and centrality. The basic idea is to run through a curriculum and try to find a match for each of its courses in the other curriculum. We can then analyze the differences between these pairs of courses.
